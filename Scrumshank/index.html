<h1> Goals and Motivation</h1>
<p>The common goal of the Embedded Software Design course this year was to design a Thief Simulator. 
This is a game in which a player needs to get from point A to point B as fast as possible, while avoiding 
obstacles and solving puzzles along the way. This idea was based on the wildly successful video game Persona 5, 
which features a group of supernatural "phantom thieves" that can sneak into a person’s mind and steal their 
twisted desires to change their evil nature. Some traps were also inspired by those found in classic spy movies 
and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WbPPD0w.png" alt = "indiana_muhl" style="width:620px;height:349px;">
<p> Each group in the class was tasked with designing a trap (or multiple traps) to act as the obstacles in the game.
 Additionally, one team would design the central hub (brainframe) to control all of the traps, and keep track of scoring.</p>
 <p>To play the game, a player would approach the first obstacle and wait for the brainframe operator to tell them when 
 to begin. When the brainframe operator begins the round, the time will start and the player can start traversing the course. </p>
 <p> Scoring for the game is time based. The clock counts up in seconds. If the player trips or fails a trap, a penalty is sent 
 to the brainframe which adds time to the player’s overall time. This penalty is usually scaled based on the difficulty determined 
 by the brainframe. If a trap is not tripped, no time penalty will be added. However, each time a trap is tripped, the trap will tell 
 the brainframe to add the penalty to the player’s time.  Players should aim to complete traps quickly and carefully to ensure their 
 final time is as low as possible.  Unlike a normal “High-Score” system where players strive for the most points possible, the objective 
 of this game is to have a low score.  Since the goal is to carefully speed through multiple traps, it was determined that players should 
 be scored on lowest time instead of highest score. This was the most practical solution as the brainframe would have no way of knowing 
 whether a trap was successfully traversed, as no trip or access messages would be sent if the player passes through undetected. </p>
 <p>The Brainframe uses an NRF network to wirelessly relay signals to Branches and Leaves. The Branches and Leaves help classify 
 traps into their own sections.  Each group has its own Branch trap, and the remaining traps are Leaves.  In practice, the Brainframe 
 would send data to the Branch trap and this Branch trap would further spread pertinent data to its Leaves. </p>
 <h3>Supported callbacks:</h3>
 <p>	$brainframe start: sends a disarm to all traps, starts a 5 second countdown, sends arm to all traps, starts game timer <br>
		$brainframe arm [address] [difficulty]: arms specified trap with specified difficulty <br>
		$brainframe disarm [address] [difficulty]: disarms specified trap with specified difficulty <br>
		$brainframe difficulty [address] [difficulty]: sets the difficulty of the specified trap without arming or disarming <br>
		$net1 connected: views which traps have sent a message to the brainframe </p>
<h1> Operation and Use </h1>
<p>The Scrumshank Redemption team was responsible for design of the central hub (brainframe) and two traps. The two traps designed 
were the Operation Maze, and the MikeMic. </p>
<p>The Brainframe is used to control all of the traps in the Thief Simulator. It uses an NRF network to arm and disarm traps connected 
to the network. It can also update the difficulty of each trap. The Brainframe keeps track of scoring (time) and processing messages from 
the traps. This includes updating the score when penalties are received, and stopping the game when the appropriate access messages are received. </p>
<p>The Operation Maze was designed to simulate disabling an alarm system. The thief has to bring a ball through a maze without setting off the 
vibration sensor connected to the maze. When the ball reaches the end of the maze, the trap is completed and disabled. The thief will receive time 
penalties each time they trigger the vibration sensor. </p>
<p>The MikeMic is a trap that only allows access when the player keeps their hand in a certain range away from an ultrasonic sensor.  The player 
is notified of their distance from the random range and from the ultrasonic sensor using LEDs and Serial display.  After remaining in the specified 
range for long enough, the trap will disarm and allow access to the next trap. </p>
<h1> Final Results and Conclusions</h1>
<p>With nearly all initial specifications met, the Thief Simulator game turned out to be a successful project with a working deliverable.  
With variations to the intended result, the game turned out to be fully functioning without extraneous additions that were scrapped early 
on in the design process. The NRF network proved to be a challenge because of its complex, yet somewhat unreliable nature. The Embedded 
Software Design class was able to successfully set up and play the Thief Simulator. There were connection issues involving communication 
between Branches and Leaves, so the finished product resulted in 6 traps set up in succession, all connected as Branches communicating 
directly to the Brainframe. Multiple players were able to complete rounds of the game, and compare scores afterwards. </p>

<h1>Usefulness of Slack</h1>
<p>Slack as a means of communication and file transfer between members was helpful in completing tasks on time and with less issues. 
It was useful for group work, ease of communication between peers and professor, and quick file sharing between group members. For 
this project specifically, the ability to contact Professor Muhlbaier with questions streamlined the testing process. Because testing 
and bug fixing took a majority of the development time, the ability to ask for help at any time expedited the coding process. </p>
<h1>Usefulness of Trello</h1>
<p>Trello is a visual way to set up tasks that need to be finished in a certain amount of time. Using trello for this course 
is helpful to visualize all of the deliverables and assignments that need to be completed during each sprint. The ability to 
see each group member’s progress through each assignment is also helpful for gauging the group’s progress collectively.  Scrum 
as a means of work management has always been an effective way to structure the workload.  With respect to this project, it pushed 
students to work on tasks that continually built on themselves to form a cohesive end product. </p>
